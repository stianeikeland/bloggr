We had a tapas night at my place recently with all the usual suspects such as bacon & dates, blue cheese & shrooms, etc.. In addition to this Magnus brought over a large piece of beef tenderloin because he wanted to try out my [SousVide-O-Mator](http://blagg.tadkom.net/sousvide-o-mator). To cook a steak medium-rare the temperature to aim for is 54.5°C, while medium is reached at 60°C. We wanted it closer to medium-rare than medium. The machine was set at 55°C, and left until it would converge on the set temperature. We added the beef (and a bell pepper for some reason.. just to experiment I guess..) and waited. A couple of hours later (you can find the safe temperature vs time (pasteurization time) for your meat over at [Douglas Baldwin's site](http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html#Beef)).

The end result is what you see in the picture (not the best picture though, but we wanted to eat it - no time for posing..), we seared it quickly in a pan to kill surface bacteria and to get that nice brown [maillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) effect. Evenly pink, very moist and very tender.. :)

I've added bluetooth to my controller thanks to a $6 module I found at [goodluckbuy.com](http://www.goodluckbuy.com/serial-bluetooth-rf-transceiver-module-rs232.html), this means that I can control it wirelessly and follow temperature graphs from my macbook.
