 You should be able to afford something better than the cheapest SSL certificate when you're a BANK, come on, get at least the wildcard one.. and preferably one with Extended Validation so that people get that fancy green validation line in modern browsers.. Cheap bastards..  Also, the two last days most of the manjor banks in Norway have had big problems with their net bank service. According to Norwegian newspapers this problem was caused by a piece of hardware malfunctioning at EDB Business    Partner.. You're the heart of Norwegian Internet banking and you have a single point of failure?? (if the newspapers are reporting this correctly.. who knows..).. But anyway, you should have multiple redundancies in every possible point of failure when doing something like this..  .. today's little rant
