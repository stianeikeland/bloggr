Recently made a [ray caster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting) for [volume rendering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering) for one of the courses I'm taking this semester at the university. Turned out to be a very interesting and challenging assignment (I didn't really have any computer graphics background). The results are also quite pleasing if you ask me, there's really something different about producing 3d renderings of  human heads compared to the usual "check out this implementation of <insert algorithm here>"..  Here are some sample renderings:

 The two first are datasets from a [CT-scanner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography). The last one is a simulation of hurricane Isabel from the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](http://www.ucar.edu/).  EDIT: A small update of some of the final results:
