Made hop ice cream with some friends this weekend, using [cascade hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_hop). Left hop pellets in milk overnight, filtered out the remains, made ice cream batter the usual way, and then added liquid nitrogen whileÂ whisking vigorously.

Ingredients:

  * 3 dl whole milk
  * A couple of hop pellets
  * 2 dl cream
  * 2 eggs
  * 70 g suger
  * 1-2 tablespoons of honey
  * 7 dl liquid nitrogen


Tasted quite bitter (as expected), only the heavy beer drinkers really liked it.
