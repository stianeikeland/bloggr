I really like Spotify, and it's currently my main source of music. There are a couple of problems though that's keeping me from completely going to Spotify (and paying for it to avoid the ads).

So many of the artists I like are not on spotify - like Pink Floyd, Metallica, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, etc. etc.. But what's even worse is the music that once were available to you, but got removed because of rights. Some music can't be played in some countries. Lately I've had a feeling that my playlists were shrinking, and suddenly wanted to hear "Eagles - Hotel California" - a song that I've had in one of my playlists from the start. It wasn't there..

Turned off "Hide unplayable tracks".. and a bunch of red songs showed up.. Songs that once were available, that now are hidden from Norwegian Spotify listeners. After searching for replacements, about 5-10% of this particular playlist was still unplayable. Bah!

NRKbeta had a great post about this after the pirate bay trial: [Congratulations - you just wet your pants](http://nrkbeta.no/an-epic-fail/) .. They hit the nail on the head. People don't get why they can play a song in one country just fine, but just across the border you can't.. Or why you can't buy TV-series on iTunes if you live outside the US, and so on.. Rights owners, record companies, MPAA, RIAA, etc, etc, needs to loosen up a bit. The Internet is global and it's heavily integrated in our culture these days, country restrictions just creates obstacles for people - obstacles they don't get why should be there. When you add other obstacles such as DRM, forced anti-piracy propganda on original DVDs/Blurays, etc, etc, it's no wonder why pirating is so much easier, faster and better when they impose stupid restrictions like this.

And wrap up todays wail, here's a funny video Havard gave me - explaining IFPI's anti-piracy strategy:
