I want one of these:  


![](http://s3.tadkom.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/2171185463_92a40441ab1.jpg)



 It's a poster from the government body in charge of transportation in London, these were put up all over London back in 2002 when they first introduced CCTV cameras on all public transportation (?). As you might know, England is the country with the most surveillance in the world (1 CCTV camera for every 14 people) - 500.000 cameras in London, and 4.200.000 cameras in the entire country. The poster is like straight out of Orwell's 1984, and I want one! I wonder if the people that made it were playing on the Big Brother theme, I hope they meant it sort as a joke..  There is apparently also a similar poster made by an american bus company, it looks more like a war poster though.  If you have any idea where I can get these, please let me know!
